# Yache

**Y**et **A**nother **C**hip **H**eight **E**mulator

Yache is a CHIP-8 emulator, written in C++.

Yache is built on top of [Yachel](https://github.com/geospace/yachel). I did
this project to learn C++. I try to keep its code clean, simple and also to use
as much C++14 features as possible.

There is currently no documentation for Yache but I should fix this soon (or
not...).

Please, if you encounter bugs or see bad design in my code, open an issue or
create a pull request. Same goes if you want new features to be implemented.
